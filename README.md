## Functionality

* Provides tunings for various instruments and supports chromatic tuning.
* Displays deviations between -30 and 30 cents.
* Supports scientific pitch notation and Solf√®ge.

## Tests

Run `./gradlew test` to run all unit tests. In addition, there are UI tests based on image comparisons which
can be run using `./gradlew connectedCheck`. The reference images are generated using a Nexus 5X emulator
(resolution: 1080 x 1920, 420 dpi) with API level 26.

## Libraries

The Tarsos DSP library (https://github.com/JorenSix/TarsosDSP) is used for pitch detection.
